     * @brief Specialized element class for HTML self-closing (void) elements.
     *
     * This class extends the base element class to handle HTML elements that
     * don't require closing tags and cannot contain child elements or text content.
     * Self-closing elements, also known as void elements, are a specific subset
     * of HTML elements that represent standalone content or functionality.
     *
     * Common self-closing elements include:
     * - `<img>` for images
     * - `<br>` for line breaks
     * - `<hr>` for horizontal rules
     * - `<input>` for form inputs
     * - `<meta>` for metadata
     * - `<link>` for external resources
     * - `<area>` for image map areas
     * - `<base>` for document base URL
     * - `<col>` for table columns
     * - `<embed>` for embedded content
     * - `<source>` for media resources
     * - `<track>` for media tracks
     * - `<wbr>` for word break opportunities
     *
     * The class enforces the constraints of self-closing elements by:
     * - Preventing addition of child elements
     * - Preventing setting of text content
     * - Rendering with self-closing syntax (e.g., `<img />` or `<br>`)
     *
     * @note Self-closing elements are rendered without closing tags in HTML5
     * @note Attempts to add children or text content to self-closing elements
     *       should be handled gracefully (typically ignored or throwing exceptions)
     * @note This class provides specialized behavior for elements that are
     *       inherently self-contained and cannot have content
